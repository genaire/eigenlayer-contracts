## Mainnet Contract Inspector

Playing with an idea to make it easy to quickly set up small scripts/tests to simulate things on mainnet and inspect state changes.

Try it out using the two tests I've written:
* `forge t --mt test_M2Upgrade -vvv`
* `forge t --mt test_MigrateM1Withdrawal -vvv`

### Good Addresses to Inspect

Some guy I found on etherscan with depositable tokens hehe:
